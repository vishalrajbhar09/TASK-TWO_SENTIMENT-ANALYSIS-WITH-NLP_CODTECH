**Task Title: Sentiment Analysis with NLP - TF-IDF Vectorization and Logistic Regression

This repository demonstrates the implementation of Sentiment Analysis on a dataset of customer reviews. The project utilizes TF-IDF Vectorization to preprocess text data and a Logistic Regression model for classification. Key deliverables include preprocessing, modeling, evaluation, and visualization of sentiment predictions.


Key Features:

•	Dataset: A simple dataset of customer reviews with labels (positive/negative sentiments).

•	Predictions on Example Reviews:

o	New reviews were evaluated, and predictions were displayed in a bar plot for better visualization.

**This Project Matters:
This project showcases the practical application of Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques for text-based sentiment analysis. It provides a comprehensive walkthrough of preprocessing text data, building a model, evaluating its performance, and visualizing results. The inclusion of detailed visualizations like a confusion matrix and prediction bar plots enhances the interpretability of the results.
